inspired by fallout shelter
To be played by 2+ players:
	* vault-tech engineer
	* overseer(s)

* Stage 1: Vault-tec (player 1 / game master)
	* build a vault. This might be done with fast dwarves and special reaction/buildings for extra fast building.
	* stocks it up. During nuclear winter (or dwarven equivalent of that) there will be no going out. Also stuff will wear down (more)
	* installs things. Some things are only buildable by vault-tec (e.g. vault door, reactor?)
	* (optional) set up experiment. Probably in a form of script (e.g. after 10 years reactor fails) or limited resources?
		- todo: how to allow for survival then?
* Stage 2: end-of-world (player 2 from this point on)
	* dwellers arrive (all of them in one wave)
	* limited building/digging
	* outside radiation increases like crazy
	* this stage is the day-to-day living in the vault and fending off caverns creatures, etc...
* Stage 3: post-rads
	* expeditions into wasteland possible (todo: how to make it more interesting then "reaction that removes units for a while")
	* radiation is still a thing, but not that insane. Units from outside will have to be cleaned not to track rads into vault
	* allow some building outside
	* some attacks might begin now
* Stage 4: vault city
	* open vault
	* rads low/very low
	* allow all buildings
	* more attacks
	* geck?

Scenarios:
	* military installation (e.g. bunker)
	* robots
	* nuke on vault (at stage 2)
	* civ uprising (change civ for some part of units)

Random things:
* vault door will be iron walls + special building that would move wall in one direction if mech-power is applied
* most of buildings will need special item that wears down in time
* most of workshops will need power (from reactor)
