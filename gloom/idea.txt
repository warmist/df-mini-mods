fort mode mod centering around forbidden, dark dwarven magic. Usually fueled by souls, bodyparts, and mechanical energy.

Progression idea:
	blood and flesh
	souls and soulshards
	applied demonology?
	+ random things not needing any of above
	
randoms ideas:
	soul transplantation
	bodypart extraction
	ghost pinning (statues from ghosts + memorizing)
	-some way to use misery of your dwarves
	liberal application of force (e.g. fortress guard beating random dwarves)
		could be cool if fear would stop dwarves from tantruming
	arena. TO THE DEATH!
	torture?
	blood as fuel
	failures:
		moods for dwarves (maybe not a failure? berserk better than wasting away)
		various evil mists (or just miasma everywhere)
		explosions!
		undeads (could be hard to do)
	vein creation: create stone/metal veins using dark magics
		failure modes include creating unminable rocks
	
darker yet:
	artifial cariers of unholy blood
	brains in jars
		could be chat target
		immortal teachers
		historians (fluff)
		watchers
		-something else?
	soul cracking - destroys souls does something:
		alloys?
		ghost-like things? - wraights
		shards (needed for high level magics)?


	lazarus chamber- resurrects fallen dwarf that it is bound to
