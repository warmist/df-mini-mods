A collection of dwarven games:
split workshops, that need 1+ dwarves doing jobs (todo other split workshops for epic jobs?) that give good thoughts.
Player can join the fun by "possesing" one of the dwarves. 
Game ideas:
    * tacticus (dirk 5th edition - the smaller one)
    * some simple card game (but maybe with nicer cards)
    * maybe simplest ever-> dice (with strange dice)
