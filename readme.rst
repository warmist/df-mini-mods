This is a collection of mods for a game "Dwarf Fortress". These mods are specially packed to be used by a script in dfhack (gui/mod-manager) and most of them uses dfhack.

==========
Unfinished
==========
These are unfinished or not even started mods. Most have `idea.txt` file that tries to capture the spirit of each mod.

Books
=====
A very ambitious mod to allow writing custom books capturing the events of the world, your fort or specific individuals.

Bulletin Board
==============
A new building that gets visited by dwarves to post thoughts, ideas and pictures.

Although this mod is working the general idea is somehow flawed and is not as interesting/easy/nice to use.

Feeding station
===============
A workshop that would refill animal food levels. Could use itself up in the process.

Slab Signs
==========
A way to post messages (visible in the sidebar when using `q`). Bonus points if in adventure mode it would also be possible to see.

Obelisk
=======
An undead controlling obelisk. Issues jobs to undeads so that you could indirectly control them.

Phylactery
==========
A chamber or a workshop that would resurrect dead dwarves. Be warned: evil side effects might happen.

Mechanical workshops
====================
A collection of machine power accepting workshops.

========
Finished
========
Mods that are mostly finished.

Spatter
=======
A repack of mod that is included in dfhack. Allows you to coat weapons with poison.

Steam Engine
============
A real working steam engine. With magma engine variant.

Display case
============
A workshop with nice sidebar that displays your prized artifacts.
